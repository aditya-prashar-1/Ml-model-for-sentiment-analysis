So, I watched it. Part of the reason I watched it is because I'm a big Science Fiction/Fantasy nerd and this movie seems influential/mentioned a lot. It was a good movie, but I'm curious why it seems such a big deal with the SFF crowd. The only mention I see of anything related to SFF is at the beginning it says something like ""sometime in the near future"". Is it because the plot of the movie is similar to a lot of fantasy plots, a trek across dangerous lands?

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Azerbaijan,"Hello there,

this is day 5 of a filmic journey across Europe. Following the official list of european nations by the Council of Europe in alphabetical order, I want to create a list of the most popular movie set in each given country. Yesterday, it was Austria's turn, and to a certain extent in keeping with the heights of the Alps, this was also the thread with the highest participation to date.

I was a bit surprised by two things: On the one hand, I find it remarkable that not a single James Bond film was actually mentioned. On the other hand, I really expected *The Sound of Music* to win. However, this film is almost completely unknown in German-speaking countries and especially in Austria itself. That's why another film has won here, which many may not even know in the original, but in the U.S. 1:1 remake by the same director: ***Funny Games***.

Now that we've sorted that out, we're heading straight to the next country today: **Azerbaijan**. The rules are as follows:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, espeically when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to only name one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Chances of finding very old film from 1914 to 1918?,"In my town, there used to be a pleasure garden called Rosherville Gardens. It was essentially a rich Londoners ""country escape"" When trains became a bigger thing, the gardens shut up shop and and finally closed when WW1 broke out. 

Few images survive BUT several films were filmed there before it was shut and demolished. What are the chances of finding obscure British films made in the early 1900s?

So far, I have managed to find out that a production company called Magnet Films used it as a filming location for a film in 1914. I am not sure on the turn around time for films of that era but there was also a war on so maybe film was released between 1914 and 1918?

Others where filmed there between 1906 and 1911 but I don't know the names of the films. If I can find this or if it even still exists, it will be the last time the gardens would have been in ""Full Bloom"" so to speak. ",0.99,6,0,6

movies,Do you think murder mystery thrillers work better if the killer is known to the hero/a known character?,"Spoilers for a variety of movies ahead, so if you aren’t well versed in murder mystery movies but are interested in them it might be better to not read.

Do you think a murder mystery movie is better off when the killer is a complete stranger or someone we are introduced to as a main cast member?

For me, I find when Hollywood tries to do the “it was this good guy along” cliche it’s almost always just so forced and weird.

I love Along Came A Spider, and I can even see the idea of the killer being a cop something that could make sense. But making the killer the very detective who works alongside Cross always felt a little… just ok? I mean it makes for a decent reveal I guess, but also feels so forced considering how crucial he was to the investigation. 

In Se7en we have the complete opposite — the villain’s actor gets no billing in the marketing or opening credits and we don’t see his face until near the end. 

I think in comedy movies, having a killer be a main cast member does make sense — Clue, Club Dread, Murder Mystery, etc, where it feels more like you’re invited to play a game of Clue as the story progresses. But for darker and serious thrillers I find the “it was secondary protagonist all along” trope a little tiresome and predictable. I think more often than not it works so much better as a complete stranger to the protagonist, which is how it would go down 99% of the time in real life.",0.58,5,0,5

movies,"Opinion: I'm getting tired of ""Today's cinema is just sequels and reboots"" discourse.","Now i know that nowadays corporations like Disney or Warner tend to prefer IPs and franchises like Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Harry Potter etc. over original ideas and most of the time if they do that it result in flops (likely because the studios never believes in an original idea) and i know some people might getting tired of franchises and reboots of popular movies but just thinking cinema is now reduced to that is for me at least kind of an exageration.

First reboots always existed before the 2000s. For a few examples the 1990s Psycho trilogy or the King Kong movie of the 1970s or even Scarface with Al Pacino was in fact a remake of 1932 Scarface. Disney also did remake 101 Dalmatians back in the 90s and did 2 live action movies. Hollywood isn't much new to rehash old ideas and capitalize on it with nostalgia or just willing that the people will just go out to see it based on the title and what they're rebooting. Also they did out-of-time sequels of very old movies too like Return to Oz sequel to the Wizard of Oz (who also had some reboots and remakes over time) in 1985 exactly 40+ years after the original came out.

Second point is that there are always new ideas out there despite what there's on the market right now. On a side sure we have Avengers Doomsday &amp; Secret Wars, new Star Wars movies and other franchise or IP related content. But on the other side there are movies or new IPs who i can see becoming cult movies in the next few decades whatever is an original idea or an already existing proprety or franchises that is just becoming popular now.

The Holdovers, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Terrifier, Dune, Superman and the whole new DCU, Mickey 17, Civil War, Challengers, The Bikeriders, Trap, The Last Airbender animated movie (which became popular during the pandemic thanks to Netflix) and literally every A24 movie. I can see people looking back on those movies in like 2040 and remember it like people grew up in the 80s remembered Star Wars or E.T. or Friday the 13th.

Then i could be wrong. I'm writing this after i saw a discussion like this on another sub who said exactly that and if you think that cinema is just sequels or reboots is totally fair and i'm not to try to convince everyone and just saying an opinion that can be wrong. But like i say i am just sick to see people pretend that there can't be any new idea or franchise beside already existing ones.

movies,Enemy - a tale about the city as much as the characters? [REVIEW],"""Chaos is order yet undeciphered.""



Enemy was exhilarating, I was so tensed during the whole movie about what was going on and couldn't look away. Even if you set aside the doppelganger plot of the movie, the world and details in it that Denis Villeneuve created are beautifully exhausting and suffocating. I was taking screenshots and zooming in to a scene of a character turning off lights because I wanted to see if the design of the switches mean the setting is a dystopian one, that's what this movie was doing to me lol

It has this dystopain kafka-esque feeling to it that you can't stop what's happening and you don't know what's happening. The city in Enemy has this perpetual yellow haze over it that seems to wash over on everything and affect the characters as well as what's going on in their minds. The two characters often have vivid dreams of the city scape with a giant deformed spider walking above it and it seems to represent to me, this influence of ugliness and stagnant-ness. It's like a cloud of yellow exhausting cancer over everything which detoriates itself into people's subconciousness and makes them do ugly things. 

Regardless of whether or not you understand it or not or whether there is something to understand about it, Enemy is a suffocating, beautifully acted and well-directed movie that evokes feelings in me that movies rarely do.

It's a very focused and well constructed movie, like details I mentioned feel intentional, like they mean something or maybe they don't and it's just a stylistic choice.

There are theories that the whole point is that the whole thing is in Jack and Danny's head and there is nothing supernatural. That the whole thing is about Kubrick faking the Moon Landing. That it's about Native American genocide. That all of the continuity errors involving the layout of the Overlook MUST be intentional. So many theories about what the final shot of the movie means...

But Stanley Kubrick said that it was just a story about a man driven insane by ghosts and his own inner demons, and Jack is the reincarnation of the previous caretaker. There's not that much more to it. This hasn't stopped theorists, who insist that either Kubrick was lying, or that it doesn't matter if he says that the curtains are blue, death of the author means that they can interpret the curtains being blue as meaning whatever they want.

«\[…\] 3. it is only allowed to shoot with one camera. \[…\] 5. Optical manipulation is forbidden, as is the use of filters. \[…\] 6. The film must not contain any superficial action. (Murder, weapons, etc. are not allowed.) \[sic!\] 7. temporal or geographical distortion is forbidden. (This means that the movie must take place in the here and now.) \[sic!\] \[…\] 9. The film format must be 35mm Academy».

This is a counter-movement to the auteur theory of the 60s. Many films made according to these Dogma 95 rules violate some of these vows of chastity, which makes the films seem even more ironic.

Under these -and other- circumstances, the movie “Idiots” was produced by Lars Von Trier (aforementioned founder of the Dogma 95 movement), which is about a commune of young adults who prank other people by pretending to be disabled. The plot begins with a middle-aged woman who joins them to put a terrible event from her private life behind her.

The movie «Idiots» was filmed in a very atypical format for movies of that time. Although the film was later transferred to 35mm for theatrical release, it was shot entirely on a Sony DCR-VX1000 videocamera. At the time, this recording device was often used by skateboarders, but was originally designed by Sony for the broadcast industry, giving the film a documentary feel unlike most movies shot on roll film.

But was this documentary effect only due to the director’s choice of camera? What can we say about the other conditions of Dogma 95? What influence did they have on the finished film?

As Marshall Mcluhan once wrote, «the medium is the message», it would make more sense to say the following about the movie «Idioten» (original title in Danish: Idioterne): «Dogma 95 is the movie». The rules under which Lars von Trier made «Idiots» have a certain relevance that we cannot neglect. Therefore, in this short essay, we will examine to what extent the observance (or non-observance) of the Dogma criteria correlates with the «documentary» effect of the film Idioterne (1998).

movies,What if Walter Matthau was in Amadeus?,"Question, What if Walter Matthau was in Amadeus?

This is an interesting movie story that I find interesting, Apparently, According to Milos Forman's autobiography, one studio offered to fund the film on the condition that Forman cast Walter Matthau (a reported Mozart enthusiast) for the role of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Forman refused the offer, considering Matthau to be too old for the role, since he was more than 60, and Mozart only lived to be 35.

However, Matthau shed some light on this. On the Los Angeles Times and I quote, Matthau said: “I wanted to play Salieri in ‘Amadeus.’ I called Milos Forman, who directed it, and I said, ‘Listen Milos, I want to play Mozart.’ He said, ‘ *Mozart died at 36* .’ I said, ‘That’s all right. I can play 36.’ ” Matthau’s deadpan expression broke slightly and a hint of a smile curled his lips. “See, I thought he would say, ‘You’re not right for Mozart, you can possibly play Salieri.’ But he never suggested it.”

I think what happened was that Matthau did wanted to be in Amadeus, but as Antonio Salieri. However, he kind of ruined it with his deadpan joke on wanting to play Amadeus as Milos really didn't get the joke.

Here is the article- [Walter Matthau: TV Actor? - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-03-04-tv-2329-story.html)

movies,Really confused about Clash of the Titans (2010),"What the hell was up with the stupid ""screw the gods"" angle? Were the writers atheists or something? I know in earlier drafts Zeus was meant to be a villain hence the unfinished cut original ending (and yes, in Greek mythology, the gods are dicks most of the time) but in the final film he's a good guy and almost everyone outside of Perseus who flips of him or the gods in general are made out to be villains or assholes. And even then Perseus spends most of the movie acting like a pouty child blaming Zeus and the other gods for his family's death something that was an accident, and even then was really only Hades' fault!

Wrath of the Titans may not have been fantastic, but at least they dropped this angled and instead went ""Oh yeah, flipping off the gods and making Zeus weak for petty reasons is a BAD thing and we fucked up and now Chronos is at risk of breaking free!"" So why even HAVE the stupid atheist angle in the first place?",0.31,0,0,0
movies,Studying film has changed and almost ruined film for me.,"To preface. I'm a huge over thinker. 

I've taken a few classes on film throughout my HS thru college career and its changed how I consume film in a lot of ways. 

Example of classes;film history, creative writing, sci-fi vs fantasy, cinematography, film theory,  ect. 

There's a general rule in film about not wasting the run time. Never show information that doesn't matter. If someone had flickering lights at their house and mentions it. Those lights will go out during a shootout or an important moment. If someone keeps tieing their shoe. That shoelace will cause a major moment change later in the movie. 

If you start to see specific cinematography cues, things becomes super obvious. Like two people always being in blue background light together and then something happens and all of a sudden the 2nd person is under red background light. It's all subtle but it's a huge unsaid thing but it shows change in the relationship of characters. 

There's a lot of examples of cases of things like this and it's almost ruined film for me because I start analyzing every aspect of a movie once I see patterns, and I start looking for the next pattern. I see an obvious hint and I'm like..okay well there's the surprise for later. That's no fun. 

Do you guys feel like this at all or what yours relationship with film?",0.42,0,0,0
movies,I can’t believe how well done the Hunger Games Saga was,"Everyone that wants to make a book into a movie needs to study this series. They took the entire book and then gave the perspective of people that it didn’t even cover since it was limited to Katniss’ POV.

Also, the cast is perfect. Jennifer Lawrence embodies the type of stress and anxiety and trauma that someone in Katniss’ shoes would be going through. Just incredible.

I’m amazed at how easy they made it look sticking to the source material. It’s like the producers knew that the book was all everyone needed, but to see it instead of reading it.

I watched these only once through with each title except for seeing the first one a couple times when it was still new, but I was too young to realize that this series isn’t just about dystopia, but mostly about propaganda. It feels uncanny seeing the political side of the war alongside the carnage of it on an even scale. It reminds me of what everyone is going through right now all around the world, and how we take our sides based off the information we find acceptable. This saga only gets better and more relatable with age.

movies,Toy Story is way more disturbing than I realized when I was young.,"My kid has an ear infection, so he was up all night, and we watched Toy Story. I don't know if it was the sleep deprivation or if I'm just now realizing something that was obvious this whole time, but this movie is something else. Aside from getting a lot of the humor that I didn't pick up on when I was young, I realized just how disturbing the whole premise is, and how it drew upon many other thriller and horror movies of its time. I think I always realized that Sid's house was pretty creepy, but it goes so much further than that. 

A group of sentient beings live in constant fear of their true nature being discovered by their ""owners."" Despite this, they feel benevolence toward the oppressors, probably due to Stockholm Syndrome. 

Buzz Lightyear, a being among the group of oppressed suffers from paranoid delusions as a coping mechanism. Upon learning that his entire self-identity is a lie, and that he is actually one of a group of mass produced pawns, he attempts suicide in a delusional stupor, and loses a limb in the process.

A particularly sadistic owner (Sid) commits genocidal acts against the toys, from exploding them for fun to performing atrocious experiments on them. At one point, he tortures Woody by burning him, telling him ""we have methods for making you talk."" The movie makes clear that he does this all for his own pleasure.

The genocidal experiments make the film one of the most notorious body horror pictures of the '90s. Toys are mutilated beyond recognition at the whim of sadistic Sid. 

There's other components, like the group of alien toys that know nothing outside of the machine in which they reside, creating an entire cult-like religion with their god, the claw. There's the mob justice the group of toys carry out against their leader, throwing him out a high window as punishment. Whole movie is gnarly. 10/10",0.46,0,0,0
movies,Anybody else felt nausea or crippling fear while watching the new Godzilla movies?,"Okay so I should clarify, my favourite genre of movies is Horror. I love scary movies, I don't have the sleepless nights after, and I especially enjoy Japanese and Korean horrors. Now that that's out of the way -

I watched Godzilla in 2014 and in it, Godzilla is barely visible. Just another run of the mill action flick I thought, and moved on. Fast forward to 2019, and I went to watch the second film in the franchise, King of the Monsters, alone at the cinema. It was weeks after release during the day, so the cinema was fairly empty. 

I remember watching this movie and finding the sheer size of the monsters and Godzilla (and perhaps the cinematography) to be nauseating. I don't know if it triggered some sort of megalophobia, or whether it was just the shaky camera work, but I remember having to look away numerous times. I've had a fear of earthquakes since childhood when I experienced one in 1993 in Mumbai, and our cast iron 7 feet tall Godrej wardrobe was shaking like a rattle toy, along with our swaying apartment block. 

I wanted to see if anyone else felt similar reactions to the movies. I've given up watching the latest ones coz they look extremely silly. ",0.2,0,0,0
movies,Unpopular Movie Opinions,"Had this discussion about sitcoms yesterday so it got me thinking about my unpopular movie opinions. 

Dances with Wolves is a better movie than Goodfellas and deserved to win Best Picture

Pearl Harbour is actually a really good movie. I thought it was cheesy and lame when it came out but it actually one of my favourites now. 

Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are the only Christopher Nolan movies I like, and I actually hate Interstellar. 

Hook is not actually a good movie. We liked it as kids and we rewatch it for pure nostalgia. 

Die Hard 2, Die Hard with a Vengeance and the uncut version of Live Free or Die Hard are all better than Die Hard. 

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the only worthwhile Indiana Jones movie worth revisiting on the regular.

movies,Why Wasn't The Hobbit Trilogy as good as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy?,"I think most would agree that the LOTR trilogy is much better than The Hobbit trilogy.  The Hobbit trilogy could have been close to as epic as the LOTR trilogy but it just didn't have the magic IMO.  It didn't feel as epic.  Trying to put my finger on why that is.  Here are some ideas.  What do you think?

* The dwarves are slapstick.  I feel like LOTR had a more serious tone and the dwarves were always singing and have the equivalent of fart humor for the most part.  In LOTR there was a sense of dread and foreboding when it came to the threat of Sauron, Saruman, the Nazgul etc...
* We aren't introduced to very many new and unique places.  Many locations are re-hashes of old locations we have been to or similar places that we have been to.  We are introduced to so many new places in the LOTR trilogy in every movie.  Just think of Fellowship - The Shire, Bree, Isengard, Rivendell, The mountain pass of Caradhras, Mines of Moria,, Lothlórien, The Gates of Argonath.  None of the Hobbit movies come close to introducing that many cool new locations.  I will say the whole Necromancer / Gandalf subplot was great.  This was a new location with a new / powerful threat.  If only the rest of the trilogy could be at that level.
* Over reliance on CGI.  The LOTR CGI was cleaner and blended better with the practical effects.  Some of the Hobbit CGI was overdone and fake looking IMO.
* Messing up Logolas' character.  He went from badass hero in LOTR to a jealous boyfriend type in the Hobbit movies.
* Pacing - The Hobbit was stretched to thin vs the source material.  LOTR was three books.  The Hobbit was one book.  Too much time spent trying to fill in the gaps so that Tolkien's work isn't there as much.
* The villains weren't as scary.  Besides a brief encounter with the Necromancer the villains weren't as bad in The Hobbit trilogy.  Nothing was as threatening as Sauron, Saruman, the Nazgul, etc...    Azog is just big orc and Smaug talked too much IMO.  I mean after having a 20 minute conversation with Bilbo he just didn't seem as threatening.  The Great Goblin wasn't scary at all.

movies,Why do so many movies revolve around fathers &amp; son/daughters,"Ever since I was a child, I’ve always watched movies, but as a male raised by a single mother, I notice that a lot of movies and shows depict households that are primarily father-son or even father-daughter relationships. As I’ve gotten older and watched more movies, I’ve realized there aren’t many focused on a mother and son, which I find strange. I especially feel awkward when watching a new movie—or one I want to rewatch—with my mother, and the plot is centered around a father and son. For some reason, when I see a new movie with that kind of storyline, I feel bad or some sort of pity for my mother, since neither of us can relate to it.

movies,Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind Ummm Yikes...,"I just saw the movie the first time and well, am I the only person that got a huge ick and very uncomfortable watching the movie?  The acting and story telling were excellent, so from that standpoint, the movie was great.  But the themes/characters in the movie made me very uncomfortable and icky and the characters themselves were morally not great, other than Clementine who was just living her life freely and got pulled into all of this.  I think they made the male characters very relatable to many males out there, which was very smart of the movie creators, but is also what made it very icky.

  
SPOILERS: This is just my take on the whole thing:

&gt;!**Joel**: Middle aged introverted socially awkward insecure male who doesn't know himself that well and has low levels of emotional intelligence/social skills. Similar to many middle aged males out there, he is not living a fulfilling life and has little or no sense of direction. Meets and finds Clementine attractive because she is a younger hotter female who is able to live in the present and live life freely.  Basically, he's attracted to her because of her 'free spirt' energy, and more into what she makes him feel rather than her as a person.  It's like your middle aged office male falling for a rave girl.  Clementine even mentions that that's why guys are into her - the excitement and the ups and downs due to her impulsiveness, giving them something interesting in otherwise their mundane life - but not actually into her as a person.  And I'd imagine the good sex that comes with it to. This is evident though Joel's inability to commit to her, and lack of desire to have kids with her.  He sees her as a source of entertainment and excitement and escapism from his boring life, while she actually is looking for some sort of romantic, LTR.  As a typical insecure person would do, Joel also makes assumptions that she'd cheat on him, because he doesn't understand the free spirt style of life.  But Clementine is just being herself.  Anyways, Joel gives me mid levels of ick.!&lt;

&gt;!**Clementine**: She literally comes off like just a young free spirit girl like you could find at a rave or festival.  Impulsives, has some mental health problems (she admits to anxiety, prone to boredom), but values living life to the fullest and being in the present.  For whatever reason she's into Joel - no ideal why, maybe he seems to be a good person and stable and consistent.  No ick here!&lt;

&gt;!**Dr. Howard**: High levels of ick.  Forcefully erases memories from Mary without her consent to cover things up. Runs a questionable medical practice - people seem to either regret or have side effects greater than what they were told (like getting drunk).  Even though Mary seemed to be the one coming on to him, he still has a wife and kids.!&lt;

&gt;!**Patrick**: Straight up predator, preying on vulnerable and emotional unstable women (like Clementine).  Most likely into her the same way Joel is, but from a predatory standpoint manipulative druggy/rapey standpoint.  Joel just into her from the lack of direction standpoint.  Huge huge ick. Seems like the predators you'd find at clubs or raves.!&lt;

&gt;!**Mary**: Directionless female, who happens to be into older men.  She's young so get's a pass but minor ick.!&lt;
